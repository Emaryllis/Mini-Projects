# War - Card Game

---

This project was undertaken to deepen the understanding of advanced programming concepts, with a particular focus on:

-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

    -   Utilizing concepts like inheritance and encapsulation to structure code in a modular and reusable manner.
    -   Applying OOP principles for designing and implementing a card game.

-   **Recursive Functions:**
    -   Exploring recursion as a programming technique to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
    -   Demonstrating the application of recursion in the context of game logic and flow.

By developing a War card game, this project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce these advanced concepts, fostering a more robust understanding of their application in real-world scenarios. The implementation of the game involves creating a Player class, handling recursive functions for resolving conflicts, and employing OOP principles to structure the codebase efficiently.

This repository showcases how these concepts can be integrated to create a cohesive and functional program. The codebase serves as a valuable resource for anyone seeking to learn or reinforce their understanding of OOP and recursive programming through a hands-on project.
